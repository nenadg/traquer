# traquer
Records and reproduces user's in-page behavior

Traquer is a tool that enables you to record a testing session on you web/page/app, than reproduce it, monitor how it performed, create a naïve heatmap, and even automate your testing sessions using Selenium Webdriver and Jasmine...

Original blog post about this is already here - http://lessgeneric.com/testing/traquer-testing-made-easy/ so go check it out.


# Record and playback
In following example, you'll see a record and playback on Ext JS example called 'Admin Dashboard'.

Another example shows that there is actual list of recorded cases, which you can use to set up playback.

# Heatmap
You can create heatmap from one ore many cases.

# Playback after DOM mutation
In this example, I've reloaded page which means - new element id's (testing hell).

# Export/import to different browsers
Here, I'll create case in Firefox, export it from there, and import it to Chrome. It'll perform good.

# Joining cases
In this last video for this post, I'm showing how to join multiple cases to one 'mega-case'.

# Work in progress
This is WIP, some features don't work as they should (jasmine/seleinum automation for example).
